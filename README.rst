The ``mpirical`` package provides an easy way to execute parallel Python code (or any Python function)
in parallel with MPI.  It uses the ``mpi4py`` package to enable parallel MPI executation in Python, but
unlike ``mpi4py`` on its own, ``mpirical`` automatically executes decorated functions with ``mpirun``
or ``mpiexec`` *for you*, instead of requiring that the user run their Python code with ``mpirun`` or
``mpiexec`` explicitly.  All of this is done in the background!

See the documentation_ for more details.
